"""Repair issues for the amplifier settings that power control depends on.

Home Assistant owning power is only safe with three settings on the amplifier,
none of which it can set for itself:

* Auto On method **Power Button** -- otherwise the amp wakes zones by itself;
* every channel's sleep **OFF** -- otherwise it switches zones off by itself;
* every zone's turn-on volume **-70 dB** -- a zone-on plays about a second
  unmuted at that level, whatever its mute (measured, and heard, 2026-09-27).

A factory reset or a change in the web UI undoes any of them silently, so they
are read at setup and daily, and each gets a repair issue while it is wrong.
